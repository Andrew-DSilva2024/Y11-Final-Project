        <h3>Eighty years into the future, the world’s climate will depend heavily on the choices made today. In a best-case scenario, where global emissions fall sharply and warming is limited to 1.5–2°C above pre-industrial levels, atmospheric carbon dioxide could stabilise near 450 ppm by mid-century before slowly declining.</h3>
        <h3>Sea level rise might be held to about 0.3–0.6 metres by 2100, still threatening low-lying coasts but manageable with adaptation. Extreme weather would remain more frequent than in the 20th century, but ecosystems and agriculture could adjust, preventing mass collapse. In contrast, under a worst-case scenario of continued high emissions, CO₂ could exceed 900 ppm by 2100, and global temperatures could rise by 3–5°C. Sea levels might climb over one metre, displacing hundreds of millions of people from coastal regions.</h3>
        <h3>Food systems could face severe strain, with crop yields in some tropical regions declining by up to 30% while global demand rises. Health risks would also escalate, with an estimated additional 250,000 climate-related deaths per year by mid-century from heat, malnutrition, and disease—numbers likely far higher by 2100.</h3>
        <h3>Biodiversity could suffer catastrophic losses, including near-total disappearance of coral reefs and collapse of Arctic ecosystems as summer sea ice vanishes entirely. Economically, unchecked climate change could slash global GDP by up to 18% by the century’s end, disproportionately affecting the poorest nations.</h3>
        <h3>This stark divergence between a stable but stressed climate and a deeply destabilised planet underscores the importance of immediate action. The future is not yet fixed, but the trajectory of the next 80 years will be shaped by the urgency and effectiveness of today’s climate decisions.</h3>
