    <h2>Eighty years into the future, our planet’s fate will depend on the choices we made today, a time when science, technology, and moral responsibility will define the climate humanity inherits.</h2>

            <h3>In a best-case scenario, where global emissions fall sharply and warming is limited to 1.5–2°C, atmospheric carbon dioxide could stabilise near 450 ppm by mid-century before slowly declining. This future would see renewable energy, reforestation, and carbon capture become mainstream, helping the planet recover from centuries of industrial impact.</h3>

            <h3>Sea level rise might be limited to 0.3–0.6 metres by 2100, still immensely dangerous for coastal regions, but manageable with smart adaptation such as sea walls, elevated cities, and climate-resilient planning. However, without strong action, continued high emissions could raise global temperatures by 3–5°C and push seas over one metre higher, displacing hundreds of millions.</h3>

            <h3>Biodiversity would face catastrophic losses, including near-total disappearance of coral reefs and collapse of Arctic ecosystems as sea ice vanishes.

        <h3 class="lasttext">This stark divergence between a stable but stressed climate and a deeply destabilised planet underscores the urgency of today’s actions. The next 80 years will determine whether humanity lives in balance with the Earth or faces an increasingly uninhabitable world. The choice remains in our hands.</h3>
