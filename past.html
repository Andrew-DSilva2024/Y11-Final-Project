                <h3>Eighty years ago, climate change was not the global crisis it is today, though its seeds were already being sown.In the 1940s, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels were around 310 parts per million (ppm), compared to over 420 ppm today, a nearly 36% increase.</h3>

                <h3>At that time, global average temperatures were only about 0.2 to 0.3°C above pre-industrial levels, compared to roughly 1.2°C of warming now. Sea level rise was present but slower: tide gauge records suggest a global rise of about 1.3 mm per year in the early 20th century, compared to nearly 3.9 mm per year today.</h3>

                <h3>Importantly, many of the environmental shifts now tied to climate change—such as widespread glacier retreat, more frequent marine heatwaves, and record-breaking storms—were absent or extremely rare eighty years ago. For example, Arctic summer sea ice extent in the 1940s covered around 8 million square kilometers; today, it averages closer to 5 million, with projections showing further dramatic declines.</h3>

            <h3 class="lasttext">Agricultural productivity then was shaped more by local farming practices and war disruptions than by climate stress, whereas today, climate change has already reduced global crop productivity by an estimated 21% since 1961. Human vulnerability has also escalated: while weather-related disasters killed thousands each year in the 1940s, they now affect around 124 million people annually. These stark contrasts highlight the accelerating presence of climate change over the past eight decades, showing how what was once a subtle, nearly invisible trend has become a defining threat to global health, stability, and survival. The absence of widespread impacts in the 1940s compared to the overwhelming evidence today emphasizes why urgent and coordinated action is essential.</h3>
