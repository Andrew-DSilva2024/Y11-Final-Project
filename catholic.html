        <h2>As a Catholic who actively attends Mass, I realise we must work hard to preserve what Pope Benedict XVI calls the Earth, “Our Common Home.” Climate change is an issue ignored for too long, and we cannot let it continue.</h2>

            <h3>God says in the Bible, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). As caretakers of creation, we must respect His gift and nurture the environment. In Aotearoa New Zealand, I’m influenced by Māori values that treat the natural world, land, sea, and sky, as sacred, deserving deep respect and care.</h3>

To ignore the damage we cause is to neglect God’s creation. As Catholics, we are called to live simply, reduce waste, and advocate for policies that protect both the planet and its people.</h3>
