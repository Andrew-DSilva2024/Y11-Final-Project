        <h3>Today, the presence of climate change is undeniable, with its effects visible across every continent and ocean. Global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have surpassed 420 parts per million (ppm), the highest in at least 800,000 years, compared to just 310 ppm eighty years ago. Average global temperatures are now about 1.2°C warmer than in pre-industrial times, driving more frequent and severe heatwaves, storms, and floods.</h3>
        <h3>Sea levels have risen by over 10 cm since the early 1990s, with the current rate of rise—about 3.9 mm per year—almost triple that of the early 20th century. Polar ice is shrinking rapidly: the Arctic summer sea ice minimum has fallen to around 5 million square kilometers, a decline of nearly 40% compared to the mid-20th century. Agriculture, once only lightly affected, now shows clear vulnerability, with climate change reducing global crop productivity by an estimated 21% since the 1960s, particularly harming regions like Africa and Latin America.</h3>
        <h3>Human health and safety are also increasingly at risk: approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in areas considered highly vulnerable to climate impacts, while climate-related disasters affect an average of 124 million people each year. Economically, direct losses from such events average over US$200 billion annually, with indirect costs far higher. Unlike 80 years ago, when climate change impacts were subtle and debated, today the evidence is overwhelming, measured, and visible in real time.</h3>
        <h3>The contrast between the relatively stable climate of the 1940s and the disrupted systems of today highlights not only the scale of the crisis but also the urgency for immediate, coordinated global action to prevent far more severe consequences in the coming decades.</h3>
