      <h3>Global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have surpassed <strong>420 ppm</strong>, the highest in at least 800,000 years — up from just 310 ppm eighty years ago. Average global temperatures are now about <strong>1.2°C warmer</strong> than in pre-industrial times, driving more frequent and severe heatwaves, storms, and floods.</h3>

While “doomsday” narratives can sound exaggerated, the evidence is clear — we are at a turning point. The next decade will determine whether humanity acts responsibly or faces irreversible consequences.</h3>
